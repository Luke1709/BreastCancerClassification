# BreastCancerClassification
MATLAB Project for the classification of breast cancer cells
Within this project, I will show the code used to produced my results, along with the reports I created for each section.

The project included many different approaches, such as the k-means, or Fisher's Linear Discriminant, and Clustering. In this project, I will include the code and plots produced for the k-means, and the clustering because this is most relevant for my Data analyst portfolio.
