# BreastCancerClassification
MATLAB Project for the classification of breast cancer cells
Within this project, I will show the code used to produced my results, along with the reports I created for each section.

The project included many different approaches, such as the k-means, or Fisher's Linear Discriminant, and Clustering. In this project, I will include the code and plots produced for the k-means, and the clustering because this is most relevant for my Data analyst portfolio.

The above scatter plot shows the clustering for two centroids.

The above scatter plot shows the clustering for three centroids.

The above scatter plot shows the clustering for five centroids.

For the clustering, I used the first 3 major principles to provide plots for clustering. For more information on principle components, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis

For the first two principle components, the clustering looked like:

For the first and third principle components , the clustering looked like:

For the second and third principle components, the clustering then looked like:

For more in depth insights, the reports are attached in the files.
